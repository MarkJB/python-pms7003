"""Read a Plantower PMS7003 serial sensor data.

A simple script to test the Plantower PMS7003 serial particulate sensor.

Outputs the various readings to the console.

Requires PySerial.

Edit the physical port variable to match the port you are using to connect to the sensor.

Updated to work on Python 3 (ord() is redundant)

Run with 'python pms7003.py'

The sensor payload is 32 bytes:

2 fixed start bytes (0x42 and 0x4d)
2 bytes for frame length
6 bytes for standard concentrations in ug/m3 (3 measurements of 2 bytes each)
6 bytes for atmospheric concentrations in ug/m3 (3 measurements of 2 bytes each)
12 bytes for counts per 0.1 litre (6 measurements of 2 bytes each)
1 byte for version
1 byte for error codes
2 bytes for checksum
